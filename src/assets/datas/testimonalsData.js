        description: "Jack is an online English teacher of mine, and I had several really nice and interesting classes recently. In the class, Jack is really humorous and talkative. He told me a lot about his life experiences as well as some interesting anecdotes happening among his friends. Apart from these, Jack also helped me with my pronunciations and my grammars, making me more like a native speaker. I would say Jack is really a nice person not only as a teacher but also as a friend.",

        description: "What Jack impressed me most is that he is very patient. As a non-English speaker, it's hard for me to pronounce every word well, but he would let me read after him, one by one, and reminded me not to neglect all the details. Also, he is very humorous, people will have much fun in his class. And he will teach you some native knowledge, they are quite interesting and useful. You would learn a lot with him, not only about the pronunciation, the grammar, but also some native knowledge of America.",

        description: "Jack is the most devoted and knowledgeable English teacher I’ve ever met. As an average Chinese student seeking for development in English, I consider myself lucky for having sessions with him. Not only did he correct my pronunciation errors, he also delivered me with spectacular insights in writing. The patience and devotion he has shown is also well appreciated. In spite of all that, he broadens my horizon to a new perspective to English and makes my eyes wide open to a new world. I do appreciate his hard work and thanks to him.",
